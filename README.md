# ZenCollider
A generative meditation timer for SuperCollider. This script acts as a "virtual guru," creating dynamic singing bowl chimes with subtle, human-like variations to guide your practice. An organic alternative to static timers for mindfulness and sonic art. Customize your session's length, pitch, and feel.
